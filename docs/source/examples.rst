The examples on this page showcase the available functionality of gggears package and help learning the workflow.

.. note::

    Some important lines are omitted below to save space, so you will most likely need to add 1 & 2 to the provided code below for them to work:

        1. ``from gggears import *``
        2. To view the created objects, you can use the following commands:

            - in *ocp_vscode* simply use e.g. ``show(gear_part_1,gear_part_2)`` or ``show_all()`` can be used to automatically show all objects with their variable names as labels.
            - in *CQ-editor* add e.g. ``show_object(gear_part_1)``
        3. To export parts, use build123d's export functions, e.g. ``export_stl(gear_part_1)``

.. _ex 1:

1. Basic Spur Gears
-------------------

This example demonstrates the creation of two spur gears with different number of teeth.

.. note::

    The default (unspecified) values are :py:attr:`module=1` and :py:attr:`height=1` .

2. Inside Ring Gears
--------------------

Example with a ring-gear for planetary drive construction.

    :end-before: [Ex. 2]


3. Profile shifts
--------------------

Create profile shifted gears. Use the :py:class:`tip_truncation <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteGear>` parameter to avoid sharp tips.

.. note::

    The :py:meth:`mesh_to() <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteGear.mesh_to>` function does not yet handle accurately the ``profile_shift`` parameter, so you get increased backlash with shifted spur gears.

4. Helical Gears
--------------------

Create Helical Gears. Positive helix angle is right-handed, negative is left-handed.
Use positive and negative values to create a common helical pair. The gears are calculated with the 'normal' (tool-parameter) system,
as opposed to the 'transverse' system. The :py:meth:`mesh_to() <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteGear.mesh_to>` function can account for different helix angles. Use the value ``PI/4`` for 90° crossed helicals.
The class :py:class:`HelicalRingGear <gggears.gggears_wrapper.HelicalRingGear>` is also available for planetary drives with helical gears.

5. Crowning
--------------------

Crowning is a feature that gradually reduces tooth width from the middile towards the top/bottom face, resulting in a barrel-like side profile.
Crowning can help against axial alignment errors, ensures gears don't make first contact on the edges.
The parameter ``crowning`` has a 1E-3 conversion factor, so values in the range of 100-200 have visible effect.
The value of 1 corresponds to 0.001 module arc length reduction of tooth flank on both left-right sides.

6. Bevel Gears at 90°
---------------------

Create simple bevel gears at 90° angle.

.. literalinclude:: examples.py
    :start-after: [Ex. 6]
    :end-before: [Ex. 6]

.. note ::
    Bevel gears are implemented with ideal spherical involute geometry, which does not represent real bevel gears due to manufacturing constraints.

7. Spiral Bevel Gears
---------------------
Spiral bevel gears are under development, but you can already create them with the following code.

    :start-after: [Ex. 7]
    :end-before: [Ex. 7]

8. Cycloid Gears
---------------------

Create gears wit cycloid geometry. Cycloids have no pressure angle as a parameter, but are rather defined by the radii of the generator rolling circles.
These generator circles are controlled by the ``inside_cycloid_coefficient`` and ``outside_cycloid_coefficient`` parameters.
The rolling circles need to match for meshing gears.
The :py:meth:`adapt_cycloid_radii <gggears.gggears_wrapper.CycloidGear.adapt_cycloid_radii>` function can be used to adjust the outside rolling circles of gears for appropriate meshing.

9. Racks
---------------------

Create straight racks with the :py:class:`InvoluteRack <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteRack>` class.
Racks are developed separately from the gear class structures, so not all features of gears are available for racks.
Racks can use :py:meth:`mesh_to() <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteRack.mesh_to>` function for positioning next to gears, but gears can't mesh_to() racks (missing feature for  now).

    :end-before: [Ex. 9]


10. Helical Racks
---------------------

The :py:class:`HelicalRack <gggears.gggears_wrapper.HelicalRack>` class can be used to create racks matching to :py:class:`HelicalGear <gggears.gggears_wrapper.HelicalGear>`  class.
While :py:class:`InvoluteRack <gggears.gggears_wrapper.InvoluteRack>` class also has beta angle input which corresponds to helical angle,
the HelicalRack class also accounts for normal-transverse system conversions to directly match the :py:class:`HelicalGear <gggears.gggears_wrapper.HelicalGear>` class.
